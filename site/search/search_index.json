I am deeply indebted to my mother, Millie, who used to interview relatives in the late 1950s and early 1960s every time we vacationed in either Iowa or North Carolina. I am also very lucky to have run into Pat Hageman who was managing the Moultrie County, IL USGenWeb site and who graciously sent me paperwork connecting my Paternal family tree from the mid-1800s in Illinois all the way back to the early 1600s in Ireland. Yes, I got very lucky! Since then I have spent countless hours researching in libraries and court houses nationwide, as well as many trips to cemeteries. I have taken pictures and video in states from Delaware to North Carolina to Iowa and almost everywhere in-between. The places and cemeteries are numerous as my Paternal line (Dixon) has been here in North America since 1689, almost one hundred years before the Declaration of Independence! Several other lines have similar pedigrees. I have tried several different software programs and web programs over the years, and even though I still haven\u2019t found what I consider to be the perfect or \u2018ideal\u2019 way to share my family history with other descendants, WikiTree is probably as close as I'm going to get. My oldest known Paternal ancestor is Henry Dixon . His three children William Dixon , Dinah Dixon and Rose Dixon settled in what is now northern Delaware, then part of Penn's Colony. They were Quakers. I will post other lines shortly. On my father's side, I am working on Dixon, Stanley and Stidley lines. On my mother's, Peterson, Camp and Ellis. On my wife's paternal side: Rees and Wormer. On her maternal side: Gilmore and Scruggs. Side note: my wife and I are 7th cousins, twice removed through a connection on our maternal sides through the Camp family. I am cleaning up records and adding a lot of scanned documents and images to WikiTree. Soon I will begin developing more narratives here. I am also beginning the process of logging all of my research, something that definitely belongs here, probably in the news section. NOTE: I will be regularly updating records and articles here, combining several different recent trends: Digital Garden Learning in Public Evergreen The main difference you'll see is that many of my articles/essays are works-in-progress (WIP), evolving ideas, revised and updated as needed. Therefore, they will generally not be sorted by publication date, although dates 'planted' and 'tended' are provided. Much of the current content is older, but new thoughts and notes will be added regularly as I uncover new information.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"Dixon/The%20Dixons/","text":"","title":"The Dixons"},{"location":"Dixon/dixon-origins/","text":"2022-09-10 6:39 am The story of the Dixon siblings and where they came from rests on a very shaky foundation. Most of the story relies on a single quote from Albert Cook Myers, in his seminal work \"Immigration of the Irish Quakers into Pennsylvania 1682-1750\" which was published in 1902. In it, Mr. Myers refers to a wedding listed in the Lurgan Monthly Meeting in Co. Armagh, Ireland. A William Dixson married Isabelle Rea. In attendance were both a Henry and a Rose Dixson. Myers then states the following: This, no doubt, is the same family that came over to New Castle Co., prior to 1690. Henry Dixson, it is said, kept an inn at New Castle This statement is not supported by any source at all. \"no doubt\" and \"it is said\" is extremely shaky proof, especially since Myers was publishing this information over two-hundred years after the fact! And yet, like many things in the genealogy world, it was generally accepted. Since the 1990's, when genealogy began finding its way online, this story has been copied and pasted until it seems like plain fact. One other source of information comes from the hand of Thomas Pierson, William Dixon's eventual brother-in-law. Thomas was eventually the Deputy Surveyor of Penn's Colony, and his second wife was William's sister, Rose Dixon. At some point some journal notes from Thomas Pierson surfaced where he indicates he sailed from England (southeast coast) to Marlyand \"in company with Wm Dixon.\" From this statement, many early writers assumed that this was the same William from Lurgan and the same William who was later his brother-in-law. But both of these are assumptions! So far, the main sources that are missing are the following: Henry Dixon's burial location, in either Ireland or Pennsylvania Rose Dixon's burial location, in either Ireland or Pennsylvania Birth records for William, Dinah and/or Rose (the sibling) Quaker church records for 'removal' from Lurgan for any of the siblings Quaker church records for 'arrival' from Lurgan to one of the Pennsylvania meetings Keep in mind that there are removal records showing Thomas Pierson's various trips across the Atlantic. The lack of similar records for any of the Dixon siblings is problematic. It would be rather coincidental for Thomas Pierson to sail with a William Dixon and then end up marrying a sister of a William Dixon just to have both of these Williams be different, unrelated people. But if these Dixons were from the Bristol, England area, where Thomas originated, that would resolve some of the coincidence. I have been looking into the origins of the sibling spouses to see if there might be a pattern. So far, the only pattern is that the spouses were Quaker. William's spouse Ann Gregg was from a different county in Ireland. Rose's spouse was Thomas Pierson from Bristol, England. Dinah's spouse Michael Harlan was from Lurgan and his brother Thomas witnessed the marriage of William Dixon and Isabelle Rea. Now that is also an interesting coincidence, but does not prove prior knowledge or connections from Lurgan. However, if you continue searching a bit you do find additional ties. Valentine Hollingsworth was once tasked by the Lurgan meeting to speak with Henry Dixon for 'walking disorderly.' (this did not refer to drunkenness, but rather doing things outside the Quaker principles) He later was a founder of the Newark Monthly Meeting in what is now northern Delaware. In this meeting both Rose and Dinah Dixon met, were approved for and married their spouses. The fact that the Hollingsworth and Harlan families continued their ties from Lurgan to Newark weighs in favor of the Dixon siblings also having some form of connection to Lurgan as well. The exact genealogical connection still remains unproven, however. Various Dixon researchers over the years have wrestled with this problem. E. O. Dixon, in 1996, visited Ireland and dug into the records. He proved William and Isabell were older than the immigrant William and still active in Lurgan long after the Dixon siblings showed up in Delaware. This leaves the Dixon siblings completely absent from the Lurgan meeting records. Indeed, absent from any known Quaker meeting records in Ireland!","title":"Dixon origins"},{"location":"Dixon/Mills/dixon-mills-across-america/","text":"Revised July 1, 2018 The Dixons seemed to have one thing in common: every couple of generations they got the urge to explore, to move to the frontier and stake their claim on uninhabited land. William Dixon's parents or grandparents certainly did so, most likely as part of King James\u2019 Plantation of Ireland. William and his sisters took the BIG leap and left for Penn\u2019s Colony in the New World in 1689, even as William of Orange was landing in northeast Ireland with a large force that would eventually push King James\u2019 Jacobite forces almost into the Atlantic! In the mid-1700\u2019s William Dixon\u2019s descendants moved to North Carolina and western Pennsylvania. In the early 1800\u2019s they moved on again to Ohio just a few years after the NorthWest Territories were opened to settlers. One byproduct of all this moving and exploring was that they were almost always on the outer edges of the normal channels of commerce. Thus, they were farmers. And one thing farmers both produce and consume in large quantites is grain! So it\u2019s no surprise that wherever the Dixons roamed they built and operated mills.","title":"Dixon mills across america"},{"location":"Dixon/Mills/Delaware/delaware-mill-on-dixons-run/","text":"Delaware Mill on Dixon's Run William Dixon lived in the Christiana Hundred section of far northern Delaware.

I am so thankful that my mother started interviewing relatives and taking notes when I was just a child. Most of the people she talked to are now dead and gone, bits and pieces of their memories preserved in her notebook. It was her initial investigation that enabled us to contact a distant cousin who was able to connect us to the rest of the family tree going back to 1633. Over the last several years I have been filling in the blanks and connecting the dots, but as most genealogists know for every piece of information you find you usually discover the existence of several other pieces of information which are out of your reach. As an example, I recently connected with a long lost cousin through DNA testing . Once this was established we began looking for connections from the Dixon Quakers of North Carolina to this person\u2019s oldest known ancestor who died in 1801 in Georgia. In the process I discovered where yet one more branch of Dixons had disappeared to and found several new monthly meetings where Dixons had attended. One such meeting was the Lost Creek MM in eastern Tennessee. I also ran across a book written about this meeting entitled \u201cLost Creek Memories\u201d by none other than Ben F. Dixon, the author of two major resources for our Dixon line. As it turns out he has authored over 20 books on history, mainly Quaker-related. So now there are an additional 20+ books that I know about but have no way to read as they are mostly out-of-print and are probably collecting dust on a few library shelves. Now, on top of all that which genealogists have been dealing with for years, no doubt, comes the internet. There are many web pages which I consider to be vital resources. I read them again and again finding new clues. But what if those pages were suddenly gone? What if the hosting account ended, or the owners passed away? Do I have copies of the information somewhere? And even if I have a copy, what about all the other people who might need that information? Thus, I have decided that I need to copy all of these sites and republish them on my web site. Normally this would be considered some sort of copyright infringement but when you run across a web site with vital, unique family information and it hasn\u2019t been updated since 1998 you should be scared!
