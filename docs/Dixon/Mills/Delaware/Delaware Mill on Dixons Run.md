## Delaware Mill on Dixon's Run 

William Dixon lived in the Christiana Hundred section of far northern Delaware. The northern border was -- well, there *was* no northern border, per se, as this area was still part of Penn's Colony, generally referred to as 'the lower counties." Christiana Creek, Brandywine Creek and Red Clay Creek were the other boundaries. His descendants built a stone grist-mill somewhere south of Centerville, Delaware, on what became known as Dixon’s Run. In 1804 it was listed as owned by a William Dixon. As of 1888 it was still standing and although a “very aged structure” it was still in use by the Edwin Griffith estate.
