## Jesse Dixon Mill - Napton, North Carolina 

In my direct line another of William’s grandsons, Joseph Dixon, moved south of the Cane Creek area in 1764, three miles south of present-day Siler City. While most of his siblings had moved to what was then Fayette County in western Pennsylvania, he and many other Dixons (Samuel, Nathan, Caleb, Joshua) bought land up and down Tick Creek/Tick Ridge in North Carolina for several miles. The Napton Monthly Meeting and burial ground was in the ‘middle’ of this property. One of these Dixons (Joseph' son, Jesse Dixon) built a saw and grist mill on eleven acres near the Rocky River (see map above) which operated until 1879, but had fallen into ruin by the time descendant Ben F. Dixon visited in 1934. Nearby, on the same Dixon tract, was an Old Tory Fort dating to the Revolution. As of 1934 it belonged to the estate of John J. Raskob.
