*Samuel P Dixon house, Delaware*

In 1791 [Jehu Dixon](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1163), son of [Isaac Dixon](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1159), built a fieldstone house in the eastern part of Mill Creek Hundred. After his death it eventually went to his son, [Samuel P. Dixon](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1164) who lived there until his death in 1879. He expanded the home and added a fieldstone barn and a springhouse.

Eventually his son, [Samuel C. Dixon](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1165), owned the property until it passed out of the Dixon family around 1910 or so.
